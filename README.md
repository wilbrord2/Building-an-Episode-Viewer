## About The Project
 
 This page provides a detailed exploration of the Rick and Morty TV series. At the top, you'll find key information, including the show's writers, premiere dates, and other essential details.

Below, episodes are organized by season in a structured and easy-to-navigate format. Interactive filters allow you to search for episodes by name, season, or episode number, ensuring a seamless browsing experience.

Additionally, clicking on an episode reveals more in-depth details about it. The page is fully responsive, offering an optimal viewing experience across all platforms.

##### ⚠️ Some filters are mocked like name and season I am not calling the Api
##### ⚠️ Because the Api returns 20 items per page on mobile screen we have to scroll a long list
