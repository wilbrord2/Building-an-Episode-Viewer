## About The Project
 
 This page offers an in-depth look at the 'Rick and Morty' TV series, featuring essential details in the header section, such as the show's writers, premiere dates, and other key information. Below, you’ll find a comprehensive list of episodes organized by season. The page also includes interactive filters, allowing you to easily search for episodes by their names, season, or episode number, providing a user-friendly experience for navigating through the series' extensive catalog and it is responsive across all the platform.

##### ⚠️ Some filters are mocked like name and season I am not calling the Api
##### ⚠️ Because the Api returns 20 items per page on mobile screen we have to scroll a long list
